## Pascal-Records

I'll be trying to solve a exercice that was given to a friend of mine here in Argentina in the UTN College. 

She is studying 'Systems Engineering' and she is having a bad-time with the programming side of her career.

I decided to help her and thats why this repository exists!

All this project is made on [*Lazarus IDE*](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)

You can use the compiled executable (Project.exe) to test it out or you can open the project source (Project.pas) with Lazarus and compile it by yourself

## The exercise:

#### Spanish (original):
El ejercicio consiste en crear una estructura, con registro y archivo, capaz de gestionar las cuentas corrientes de los
clientes de un banco, sabiendo que como máximo puede haber 1000 clientes y solo se deberá permitir que cada cliente
tenga tres cuentas como máximo. La información que deberá contener será: Código cliente, Titular, Número de cuenta 
(8 dígitos) y Saldo.

Generar un programa que cargue el archivo (altas) y permita listar los datos.

#### English:
The exercise consist on creating a structure, using a record and a file, that is able to manage the checking accounts
of the clients of a bank, knowing that there will be a maximum of 1000 clients, and each client will be able to have
just three accounts at the time. The data for the record will be: Client-code, Owner, Account number (8 digits) and Cash.

Generate a program that loads the file (fill it) and allows you to see the data.

#### Updated:
I added to the project the options to add data to the file without cleaning it all; and the option to modify data that already exists; this options weren't in the exercise but I tried to do them just to test the possibilities ^^

_P.S: I'm not professional at English so maybe i had more than one error writing this, sorry about that!_

_P.S 2: The code HAS NOT Procedures or Functions, the reason for this is that my friend didn't know how to use at that time and this project started to help her_
