## Pascal-Records

I'll be trying to solve a exercice that was given to a friend of mine here in Argentina in the UTN College. 

She is studying 'Systems Engineering' and she is having a bad-time with the programming side of her career.

I decided to help her and thats why this repository exists!

All this project is made on [*Lazarus IDE*](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)

All the files gotta be in the same folder, you can use the compiled executable (Project.exe) to test it out or you can open the project main source (Project.lpr) with Lazarus and compile it by yourself

## The exercise:

#### Spanish (original):
El ejercicio consiste en crear una estructura, con registro y archivo, capaz de gestionar las cuentas corrientes de los
clientes de un banco, sabiendo que como máximo puede haber 1000 clientes y solo se deberá permitir que cada cliente
tenga tres cuentas como máximo. La información que deberá contener será: Código cliente, Titular, Número de cuenta 
(8 dígitos) y Saldo.

Generar un programa que cargue el archivo (altas) y permita listar los datos.

#### English:
The exercise consist on creating a structure, using a record and a file, that is able to manage the checking accounts
of the clients of a bank, knowing that there will be a maximum of 1000 clients, and each client will be able to have
just three accounts at the time. The data for the record will be: Client-code, Owner, Account number (8 digits) and Cash.

Generate a program that loads the file (fill it) and allows you to see the data.

_P.S: I'm not professional at English so maybe i had more than one error writing this, sorry about that, contributions gladly accepted!_
